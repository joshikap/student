The first command "cd student" changes directory to my personal repository. The second command "./scripts/venv.sh" activates my virtual environment. This command, "deactivate" will shut down the virtual environment. The third command "source venv/bin/activate" looks for a virtual environment in my bin and activates it. The fourth command " bundle install" installs the necessary ruby gems for that virtual environment. The fifth command  is " code ." opens the project in vs code. The last command is "make", this generates a unique permalink to create a local host server and run my project on my local host.
